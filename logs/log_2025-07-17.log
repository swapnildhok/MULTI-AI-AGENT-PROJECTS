A cure means that the cancer has gone away with treatment and is not expected to come back, while remission refers to a period of time when the cancer is responding to treatment or is under control. Doctors may not always be able to guarantee a cure, as some cancer cells may remain in the body and can grow and become a new tumor. However, with advancements in medical technology and treatment options, some people may be able to achieve a cure or long-term remission from their cancer."}
